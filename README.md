# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

#### Green Energy Stocks Analysis
The first purpose was to write a script in VBA that would generate an analysis of green energy stocks for Steve to present to his parents. When the VBA macro is run, it generates the ticker, along with total daily volume and % return for a given year. To make the information easily consumable, it also uses conditional formatting to color stocks with positive returns green and negative returns red. 

#### Code Refactoring

The other purpose of this analysis was to refactor the original script to make it more efficient. After analyzing the green energy stocks, Steve decided he wanted to do more research for his parents by expanding the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. The original script was fast enough for the 12 green energy stocks, but the entire stock market is a significant amount more data. To make sure the script works as efficiently as possible for the expanded dataset, I needed to refactor the original code to eliminate any inefficiencies.
